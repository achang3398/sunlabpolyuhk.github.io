## Sun Lab Research Highlights

{% capture text %}

We focus on language development in children and adults, specifically the neuroscience and linguistics behind this concept. We are especially interested in how billingual vs. monolingual children process word meaning and units, as well as how Artificial Intelligence (AI) feedback helps with language learning.
